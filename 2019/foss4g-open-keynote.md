Big EO Data

Note:
- Thanks to LOC for hosting
- Invitation to give keynote on big EO data
- Tell story of journey through FOSS4G

### 1995 - 2010

remote sensing in government

- multispectral and hyperspectral exploitation
- synethetic scene modeling
- material mapping
- image registration and geolocation

Notes:
- algorithm development
- governments owned and operated satellites
- used by governments and scientists, not industry

----

Open-Source pre 2010

- Used by scientists

---

### 2011 - 2015

earth science

- climate science
- agriculture
- forestry
- Open Data: EO, LiDAR, SAR
- started in open-source
    - GeoNode, gippy, gips

Notes:
- algorithm development
- refactoring and reimplementing science code
- data management
- Downloading open data and creating ARD
    - atmospheric correction

----

vectors and web mapping

Notes:
- remote sensing wasn't a big thing
- don't want to display images
  - can you turn them into vectors?
  - with vectors you can do geometric operations

satellite imagery

the rise of smallsats

in search of the golden basemap

Notes:
- FOSS4G-NA 2015 in San Francisco

## Open Data
  - Free data downloads, use

Notes:
- Explosion of open data
- Landsat-8 (2013)
- Sentinel-2A (2015)
- Drones
- Started talking about cloud native formats
- Focus on how to consume data
- Mostly scientists still doing analysis

----

Images
- NASA showing use of Landsat images after making public
- Explosion of use on AWS - by non-scientists

----

”You are awesome, your software is awesome, [but] your software is useless, …without data.” 

- Schuyler Erle, 2010

Notes:
- Talking primarily about OSM at the time
- Now we had data
  - developers and industry started seeing what they could do with it

---

machine-learning

Notes:
- Data scientists
- moving beyond the basemap to analytics
- big EO data
- how to access at scale
- how to process at scale
- how to derive info, through ML pipelines - analytics
    - agriculture
    - climate change
    - economics
    - international development
- tech world turning to science

---

### Industry Problems

- misuse of data
- poor understanding of remote sensing

Industry misusing data

Landsat TOA'

Science Data Handbook

Notes:
- Industry saw influx of open data
- started using it
- poor understanding of accuracy and uncertainty

### 2016 - 2019

make remote sensing easier

- International development @developmentseed
- Open Standards for interoperability
- Tools and libraries to make remote sensing accessible

Notes:
- Working for development seed
- Users were now non-scientists
- wanted insights and info derived from 

---

”You are awesome, your software is awesome, [but] your software is useless, …without metadata.” 

----

If your metadata cannot be crawled and indexed, your data might as well not exist

---

## Open Standards

- Standards so far based on how data consumed
   - Web standards for consuming tiles
   - CSW
- STAC
- ARD

----

### SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs

----

### Analysis Ready Data

----



---

<img src='assets/foss4g2019.png>

- Developer-Scientists
  - getting more savvy in use and cool results
  - still issues with understanding uncertainties
  - not sure how to mix and fuse data
  - what is analysis ready data anyway?


- 2017 - Machine Learning

## Scientific Problems

Scientific Community

Notes:
- Meanwhile, scientific community had problems of their own

- The traditional scientific paper limited in scope
  - Scalability
  - Reproducibility
  - Academic IP

- Scientist coding skills
  - "spaghetti" code
  - poor data management
    - data provenance

*scientists directory

Notes:
- Scientists spaghetti code
- poor data management
- not reproducible

---

## Remote sensing is hard

- The problem with science
  - papers
  - historical analysis of big data limited
  - difficult to reproduce
  - remote sensing is hard and error prone


Notes:
- Scientitic community turning to the Open Communities
  - not necessarily know about the cloud and efficent computing
  - hard to make changes

---

- Open Source Software
  - OS software history has helped make scientists jobs easier
  - Consumers, not producers

- "Open-Source" vs Open-Source

Notes:
- Scientific community as consumers of OS
- Rarely would contribute back
  - Not developers


----

## Pangeo

A community of scientists promoting open

- xarray
- dask

- Executable Papers
